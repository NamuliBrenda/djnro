=================
DjNRO
=================

DjNRO is more than keeping eduroam.org updated with data. In essence it is a distributed management application. 
It is distributed in the sense that information about each institution locations and services is kept up-to-date by each local eduroam administrator.
Keeping in pace with eduroam's federated nature, the implementation uses federated authentication/authorisation mechanisms, namely Shibboleth plus social media itegration. 
The local institution eduroam administrators can become DjNRO admins. Local eduroam administrators register to the application via Shibboleth. 
Once the accounts are acitvated, local eduroam admins can manage their eduroam locations, contact points and institution information.
